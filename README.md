working at the intersection of **CMOS chip design**, **EDA automation**, and **biomedical systems**.

- 💡 `Digital IC` | `Verilog` | `Python` | `C++` | `System Integration`

### 📘 My Mission

I build open, scalable environments to help students:
- 🌱 Learn full IC design flows (RTL → APR → GDSII)

- ⚙️ Manage servers like pros (Linux, LDAP, automation)

> 🧠 I believe **IC education should be practical, open-source, and empowering.**
